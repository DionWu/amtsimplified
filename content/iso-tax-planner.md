description: Save thousands on taxes by figuring out how many ISOs you can exercise safely

{{<disclaimer>}}


The purpose of this planner is to help you figure out the exact amount of ISOs you can exercise without triggering the additional AMT tax. 

This can often be the key in **saving you thousands of dollars.** I personally cannot stress how useful and important this is, and how much I wish something like this existed for me in the past, which is why I built this!

You can quickly **[learn about the alternative minimum tax](/learn_about_the_amt/what-is-the-alternative-minimum-tax/)** here. If instead you wanted to calculate how much AMT you owe for this year check out our **[online AMT calculator!](/amt-calculator/)**
