{{<disclaimer>}}

The purpose of this planner is to help you figure out the exact amount of ISOs you can exercise without triggering the additional AMT tax. You can **[learn about ISOs here.](/articles/incentive-stock-option-iso-basics/)**

This can often be the key in **saving you thousands of dollars.** I personally cannot stress how useful and important this is, and how much I wish something like this existed for me in the past, which is why I built this!

You can quickly **[learn about the alternative minimum tax](/articles/what-is-the-alternative-minimum-tax/)** here. If instead you wanted to calculate how much AMT you owe for this year check out our **[online AMT calculator!](/amt-calculator/)**
