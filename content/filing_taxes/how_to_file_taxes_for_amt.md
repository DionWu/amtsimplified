Quick Disclaimer
---
Before diving into the article, I just wanted to make a disclaimer up front. I built this site as a free resource and to spread financial awareness of this tax to my friends and colleagues, as there were no comprehensive places to find information on the AMT online. 

I don't have ads, pop-ups, or charge to use any of the calculators - my goal and passion is honestly just financial education for all.

As such, you'll **only ever see me recommend one product: [Credit Karma](https://credit-karma-tax.pxf.io/amtsimplified)** 

[{{<figure src="/img/credit_karma_logo.png" class="img_logo_small" alt="Credit Karma Tax Logo">}}](https://credit-karma-tax.pxf.io/amtsimplified)


That's because:

- I use it personally (4 years and counting)
- It's **actually completely free for both federal and state.** No gimmicks, upcharges, fees, etc unlike every other product (i.e. TurboTax, FreeTaxUSA, H&R Block)
- All you need is a Credit Karma account, which many people have - no extra frills. So you can monitor your credit score, check your spending, and file taxes all in one place
- They have an amazing interface which simplifies the tax code for individuals
- Because I'm so familiar with it, I can answer questions you may have (amtsimplified@gmail.com)
- And lastly, to be frank, I'd like to cover the expenses of maintaining this site and server through Credit Karma's affiliate program or **[your generous donations here!](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/amtsimplified)** 

With that being said, let's get into it!

Quick Summary
---
- Please, for the love of all that is good, stop paying to file your taxes! I cannot stress this enough. The law mandates that everyone should be able to file for free, and there are a multitude of resources that let you do so

- My recommendation is always to file **[completely for free through Credit Karma Tax!](https://credit-karma-tax.pxf.io/amtsimplified)** I've personally been using them for 4 years now

- For most tax filing software, to calculate the tax on ISOs, you'll need a log of ISOs exercised, date of exercise, strike price, and fair market value (FMV) at time of exercise. If you aren't sure what these terms mean, you can read about the [basics of incentive stock options here](/articles/incentive-stock-option-iso-basics/)

- Please note: ISOs that you exercise and sell in the same calendar year are not subject to AMT. These will be classified as [disqualifying dispositions](/articles/iso-difference-between-qualifying-and-disqualifying-disposition/) and will be included in your regular income tax. Don't double count these!

------------------

The only 3 things you need to file your AMT
---

1. Your Incentive Stock Option exercise information
2. Calculate your ISO exercise spread subtotal
3. Fill it into IRS Form 6251 (i.e. into some textboxes on your filing software)

Step 1: Finding your ISO exercise information
---
You should be able to get all of this information in your brokerage's Statement/Tax Form section. Whether it's your individual brokerage (if you've left the company) or your company's equity center, look for a year end Form 3921. 

Form 3921 is literally titled "Exercise of an Incentive Stock Option". If you've changed companies, you may also have a Form 3922, which is just a notice that the shares you exercised were transferred from your company's equity center to your individual account. You can ignore this one.

Form 3921 should have all the information you need to proceed to step 2, including the date of exercise, exercise strike price, and fair market value of the share at exercise. 

Step 2: Calculate your ISO exercise spread subtotal
---
The definition of your ISO exercise spread, for the purposes of this calculation, is the difference between the Fair Market Value of the equity at time of exercise minus the Strike Price, multiplied by the amount of ISOs you exercised. Or in more visual terms:

**ISO Spread Subtotal = (FMV - Strike Price) * ISOs Exercised**

You would do this calculation one grant at a time. If you exercised from more than one grant, you simply just add all the subtotals together.

In the coming days, I'll be adding in an embedded calculator to help you do this here, but in the meantime, you can actually find this number by going to the [AMT Calculator](/amt-calculator) and looking for the line item in the Results section 'See Alternative Minimum Tax Breakdown'. There's a line for 'Total ISO Spread'. 

If you're just trying to see what your ISO subtotal is and not calculate your AMT, feel free to fill in any random number for your Total Gross Wages as it won't affect your ISO spread.

Step 3: Fill this number into IRS Form 6251
---

IRS Form 6251 is the form you attach to your tax return to denote any Alternative Minimum Tax. Specifically, for exercising ISOs, your subtotal will go into Row 2i "Exercise of incentive stock options (excess of AMT income over regular tax income)".

Luckily, your filing software should aide you in this without you having to hunt down form 6251 yourself. The reason I use **[Credit Karma](https://credit-karma-tax.pxf.io/amtsimplified)** is because they make this extremely clear, intuitive, and it's literally just one box to fill in.

<!--
------------------
Once you're on your tax home page, scroll down to a section titled **'AMT and other additional taxes'.** Click 'Edit/Review'.

![Credit Karma Tax Main Page](/img/ck_home_amt.png)

------------------
Then click into and Edit/Review the section on **'Alternative Minimum Tax'** 

![Credit Karma AMT Tax Sub Page](/img/ck_subpage_amt.png) -->

------------------

If this is your first time, they'll ask you to fill out a few basic questions about yourself so they know what categories of line items to ask you about (deductions, types of income, home ownership, etc). The easiest thing to do is just answer these questions as if you didn't exercise any ISOs. 

Because once you're on your tax home page, simply scroll down to the bottom and look for the search bar. **Type in AMT and click 'AMT Calculation'**

![Credit Karma Search for AMT](/img/ck_amt_search.png)

------------------

Then, simply enter your ISO subtotal from Step 2 into the box **'Exercise of Incentive Stock Options'**

![Credit Karma ISO Spread Page - AMT](/img/ck_isospread_input_amt.png)

**That's it - you're done!** The rest of the information / Form 6251 will be auto populated once you fill in the rest of your regular tax information (i.e. income, deductions, etc).
