_Please note details in this page are relevant for the **2021 tax year (filing in 2022)**, and only includes Federal Taxes._

_This calculator only highlights some of the most commonly used parts of the tax code. If you are in a unique situation, always consult with a tax accountant for any detailed questions._

If instead you wanted to calculate how much AMT you owe for this year **[check out our AMT calculator here!](/amt-calculator/)**

------------------

The purpose of this planner is to help you figure out the exact amount of ISOs you can exercise without triggering the additional AMT tax. 

This can often be the key in **saving you thousands of dollars.** I personally cannot stress how useful and important this is, and how much I wish something like this existed for me in the past, which is why I built this!

You can quickly learn more about all of this in **[these informational articles.](/posts/what-is-the-alternative-minimum-tax/)**
