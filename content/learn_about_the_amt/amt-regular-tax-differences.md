Before diving into how the AMT is actually calculated, it may be helpful to visually see the differences between the ordinary income tax that you may be familiar with and the alternative minimum tax.

[If you just want to know how the taxes are calculated, feel free to skip to this article](/learn_about_the_amt/how-to-calculate-alternative-minimum-tax)

***Key Disclaimers***
- *When using the term **'Taxable Income'**, it is referring to the uniquely calculated taxable income in that tax system. For example, with the AMT, 'Taxable Income' is actually referring to a special 'Alternative Minimum Taxable Income' (AMTI) number.*
- *We will solely be comparing AMT to the Regular Federal Income tax system, as state taxes are calculated completely separately, on top of either of these.*

General Categories
----

{{<table "table table-striped table-bordered" >}}
  Category | Regular Income Tax  | Alternative Minimum Tax
  ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 Marginal Tax Brackets | 7 brackets ranging from 0% - 37% marginal tax rate | 2 brackets: 26% and 28% marginal tax rate
 Adjustments & Deductions | Uses the Standard deduction or various Itemized deductions such as mortgage interest, and state and local tax (SALT) | Only allows for a smaller subset of specific deductions. AMT does not allow for the standard deduction
 Exemptions | None for year 2020 or 2021* | Significant AMT specific exemption based on filing status and income
{{</table>}}

*The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 removed all personal and dependent exemptions for your regular income tax. You can however, receive a Tax credit for items such as dependent care, which ultimately functions similarly.*

Marginal Tax Brackets for Taxable Income Over:

  Regular Income Tax Rate | Single Filing: | Married, Filing Separately: | Married, Filing Jointly:
  ------------- | ------------- |------------- | -------------
 10% | $0 | $0
 12% | $9,950 | $9,950 | $19,900
 22% | $40,525 | $40,525 | $81,050
 24% | $86,375 | $86,375 | $172,750
 32% | $164,925 | $164,925 | $329,850
 35% | $209,425 | $209,425 | $418,850
 37% | $523,600 | $523,600 | $628,300
{{</table>}}

{{<table "table table-striped table-bordered" >}}
  Alternative Minimum Tax Rate | Single Filing: | Married, Filing Separately: | Married, Filing 
  ------------- | ------------- |------------- | -------------
 26% | $0 | $0 | $0
 28% | $199,900 | $99,950 | $199,900
{{</table>}}

*In both tax systems for **Married, Filing Separately**, simply divide the Married, Filing Jointly income numbers in half. The only exception is for the highest regular income tax bracket (37% tax rate). In this case, those who are Married, Filing Separately receive a much more generous tax rate. That means for those millionaire-earning married couples out there, look into filing separately!*

**It is also worth calling out:**
- Your eyes do not deceive you! AMT is one of the rare instances where **being married on your tax filing status may do your more harm than good.** The marginal tax income cutoff is the same whether you are a single individual or a married couple filing jointly, so you will likely be taxed more if this situation applies. Filing jointly will make very little difference as the income cutoff gets sliced in half.

Deductions

{{<table "table table-striped table-bordered" >}}
  Above-the-line Deductions | Included in Regular Income Tax system | Included in AMT system
  ------------- | ------------- |-------------
 Traditional 401k | Yes | Yes
 HSA | Yes| Yes
 Traditional IRA | Yes | Yes
 Student Loan Interest | Yes | Yes
{{</table>}}

{{<table "table table-striped table-bordered" >}}
  Regular Deductions | Included in Regular Income Tax system | Included in AMT system
  ------------- | ------------- |-------------
 Standard Deduction | Yes | No
 Mortgage Interest* | Yes | Yes
 Personal Exemption* | Removed in year 2020 | Removed in year 2020
 Medical Expenses* | Yes| No
 SALT* | Yes| No
{{</table>}}
*Shown are only some of the most used itemized deductions. The AMT system has a much more complicated list of lesser-used exemptions/deductions. Consult with a tax advisor if you fall into this situation*

As you can see, all of the 'above-the-line' deductions still apply with the AMT tax system. Some may or may not automatically be taken from your paycheck, and thus reflected on your W2. Pay close attention when filing your taxes for the right numbers to input.

---------------

Exemptions
----
Given the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was passed in 2017, exemptions are no longer relevant for your Regular Income Tax (at least until 2025!). So the only major exemption we need to cover here is the **AMT Exemption & Phaseout Thresholds**.

{{<table "table table-striped table-bordered" >}}
  Filing Status | AMT Exemption Amount | AMT Phaseout Threshold
  ------------- | ------------- |-------------
 Single | $73,600 | $523,600
 Married Filing Separately | $57,300 | $523,600
 Married Filing Jointly | $114,600 | $1,047,200
{{</table>}}

The AMT Exemption & Phaseout Thresholds dictates three things:

1. If your Alternative Minimum Taxable Income (AMTI) is below the exemption amount, then you do not owe any AMT
2. If your AMTI is above the exemption amount, you will be able to subtract the exemption amount from your AMTI to reach your actual final taxable income. This is similar to how a deduction works in your regular tax filings
3. If your AMTI is over a 'Phaseout threshold', that means you cannot deduct the full AMT exemption amount. For every $1 of AMTI you have over the threshold, the exemption amount reduces by $0.25 (or 25% of the excess), until the exemption disappears completely.

**For Example:**
- If you are a single filer and your AMTI comes out to $528,400, you would be $10,000 over the phaseout threshold. As a result, the AMT exemption you can apply would be $2,500 (25% of 10,000) less than the normal $72,900 exemption amount, or $70,400.
- In other words, your final AMTI in this case would be $525,900 (528,400 - 2,500)

**[We cover all of this in detail here, which shows how the Alternative Minimum Tax is actually calculated](/learn_about_the_amt/how-to-calculate-alternative-minimum-tax)**
