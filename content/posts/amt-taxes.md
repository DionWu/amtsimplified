How to calculate the AMT
----
How the Alternative Minimum Tax is determined can be broken up into a few broad steps:
1. Figure out or estimate your **Total Income**
2. Subtract **total adjustments** to get your **Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)**
3. Subtract eligible **deductions** to get your **Alternative Minimum Taxable Income (AMTI)**
4. Subtract the **AMT exemption**, if eligible to get your 'Final Alternative Minimum Taxable Income'. Oddly enough, there's actually no formal term for this, so let's just call it **FAMTI**
5. Calculate your **Alternative Minimum Tax**

But Actually...
----
In practice, the above process can often be a bit confusing because you are doing things differently than you would when calculating regular taxes. Thus, what is normally done is to follow the same steps you would do when determining your Regular Income Tax, which will result in a few added steps. However, this will not only provide you with numbers you can compare across tax systems, but also will generally be helpful for your overall tax planning and make you more familiar with key terms in the tax code. 

One of the main purposes of this website is to aggregate all those disparate and sparse sources to one place. So instead, we will do the following:
1. Figure out or estimate your **Total Income**
2. Subtract **total adjustments** to get your **Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)**
3. Figure out if you want to take the **Standard Deduction** or an **Itemized Deduction**
4. Subtract whichever **Deductions** to get your **Regular Taxable Income**
5. Once you have that, work backwards by adding in either your Standard Deduction if you took it, or certain parts of your Itemized deduction to get to your **Alternative Minimum Taxable Income (AMTI)**. We do this so you can use the AMTI to calculate your AMT, and your regular Regular Taxable Income to calculate yoru regular income tax, which will be needed later.
6. Take your AMTI and subtract the **AMT exemption**, if eligible to get your 'Final Alternative Minimum Taxable Income' **(FAMTI)**
7. Calculate your **Alternative Minimum Tax**
8. Calculate your **Regular Income Tax**, which we won't go over in detail here but is automatically done [using our AMT calculator](/amt-calculator)
9. Figure out which tax is higher, and you'll be paying that one

Step 1: Figure out / Estimate your Total Income
----
If you're on this website in the midst of tax season and you have all of your financial statements ready, and are just curious about how the proverbial sausage is made, I invite you to pull out those statements and follow alongside me.

If, however, you are here to plan for any potential tax you may have to owe to Uncle Sam, or here to [plan your ISO exercise schedule](/posts/iso-exercise-planner) and want to understand the meaning behind the numbers, you will need to do your best estimation of many of the below. I often find using the previous year's tax return can be helpful.

We'll start by assessing your total income, which includes not just your salary and wages, but also things such as capital gain/loss from stock or real estate investments, social security benefits, IRA distributions, pensions, etc. 

For the purposes of this example, let's assume:
- You are filing as Single
- You have a salaried job that pays $140,000 a year
- And you have also dabbled around with the stock market, but due to unforseen global pandemics, you've lost or are projected to lose a good $20,000 on the year. 

You would end up with the below:

{{<table "table table-striped table-bordered" >}}
  Line Item | Value 
  ------------- | -------------
 Wages, Salaries, Tips | $140,000
 Capital Loss | ($20,000)
 Total Income | $120,000
{{</table>}}
_*Important to note here is that if you contribute to a Traditional 401k through your employer, the actual line item in your W2 will already reflect those contributions. So for example, if your salary is $140,000 and you are going to contribute the max amount to your 401k in 2020 (19,500), your W2 would report total wages as $120,500. For the purposes of this, we will just use your gross income (everything before contributions)._

Step 2: Subtract Adjustments and get your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)
----
There is a laundry list of possible adjustments that can be found in your 1040 Schedule 1, so we will only use some of the most common. I will also include any Traditional 401k contributions you've made here as well just to make the math crystal clear.

Let's say you are a few years out of college in your late 20s so you:
- Contributed to a Traditional 401k through work
- Are in a High Deductible Health Plan and contributing to an HSA,
- Invested in a Roth IRA, to diversify potential tax risk in the future
- In addition you're still paying off those darn student loans

Your updated table might look like the following now:

{{<table "table table-striped table-bordered" >}}
  Line Item | Value 
  ------------- | -------------
 Wages, Salaries, Tips | $140,000
 Capital Gain | -$20,000
 Total Income | $120,000
 |
 Adjustment: Traditional 401k | 19,500
 Adjustment: HSA | 3550
 Adjustment: Traditional IRA | 0 (Remember, you're in a Roth)
 Adjustment: Student Loan Interest* | $500
 |
 Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) | $96,950
{{</table>}}
<!--*There may be a chance you cannot deduct all of your student loan interest! You can read a simplified breakdown of the details here.-->
