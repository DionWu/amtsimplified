How to calculate the AMT
----
How the Alternative Minimum Tax is determined can be broken up into a few broad steps:

1. Figure out or estimate your **Total Income**
2. Subtract **total adjustments** to get your **Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)**
3. Subtract eligible **deductions** to get your **Alternative Minimum Taxable Income (AMTI)**
4. Subtract the **AMT exemption**, if eligible, to get your 'Final Alternative Minimum Taxable Income'. Oddly enough, there's actually no formal term for this, so let's just call it **FAMTI**
5. Calculate your **Alternative Minimum Tax**

But Actually...
----
In practice, the above process can often be a bit confusing because you are doing things differently than you would when calculating regular taxes. Thus, what is normally done is to add in a few extra steps that will seem a bit circuitous, but will generally be helpful for determining not just your AMTI but also your Regular Income Tax. This can come in handy when wanting to do things such as plan out your [ISO exercise schedule](/posts/iso-exercise-planner).

So instead, we will do the following:

1. Figure out or estimate your **Total Income**
2. Subtract **total adjustments** to get your **Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)**
3. Figure out if you want to take the **Standard Deduction** or an **Itemized Deduction**
4. Subtract whichever **Deductions** to get your **Regular Taxable Income**
5. Figure out your ISO Exercise Spread, and add that alongside certain ineligible deductions to determine your **Alternative Minimum Taxable Income (AMTI)**. 
6. Take your AMTI and subtract the **AMT exemption**, if eligible, to get your 'Final Alternative Minimum Taxable Income' **(FAMTI)**
7. Calculate your **Alternative Minimum Tax**
8. Calculate your **Regular Income Tax**, which we won't go over in detail here but is automatically done [using our AMT calculator](/amt-calculator)
9. Figure out which tax is higher, and you'll be paying that one

Step 1: Figure out / Estimate your Total Income
----
If you're on this website in the midst of tax season and you have all of your financial statements ready, and are just curious about how the proverbial sausage is made, I invite you to pull out those statements and follow alongside me.

If, however, you are here to plan for any potential tax you may have to owe to Uncle Sam, or here to [plan your ISO exercise schedule](/posts/iso-exercise-planner) and want to understand the meaning behind the numbers, you will need to do your best estimation of many of the below. I often find using the previous year's tax return can be helpful.

We'll start by assessing your total income, which includes not just your salary and wages, but also things such as capital gain/loss from stock or real estate investments, social security benefits, IRA distributions, pensions, etc. 

For the purposes of this example, let's assume:

- You are filing as Single
- You have a salaried job that pays $140,000 a year
- And you have also dabbled around with the stock market, but due to unforseen global pandemics, you've lost or are projected to lose a good $20,000 on the year. 

You would end up with the below:

{{<table "table table-striped table-bordered" >}}
  Line Item | Value 
  ------------- | -------------
 Wages, Salaries, Tips | $140,000
 Capital Loss | ($20,000)
 Total Income | $120,000
{{</table>}}
_*Important to note here is that if you contribute to a Traditional 401k through your employer, the actual line item in your W2 will already reflect those contributions. So for example, if your salary is $140,000 and you are going to contribute the max amount to your 401k in 2020 (19,500), your W2 would report total wages as $120,500. For the purposes of this, we will just use your gross income (everything before contributions)._

Step 2: Subtract Adjustments and get your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)
----
There is a laundry list of possible adjustments that can be found in your 1040 Schedule 1, so we will only use some of the most common. I will also include any Traditional 401k contributions you've made here as well just to make the math crystal clear.

Let's say you are a few years out of college in your late 20s so you:

- Contributed to a Traditional 401k through work
- Are in a High Deductible Health Plan and contributing to an HSA,
- Invested in a Roth IRA, to diversify potential tax risk in the future
- In addition you're still paying off those darn student loans

Your updated table might look like the following now:

{{<table "table table-striped table-bordered" >}}
  Line Item | Value 
  ------------- | -------------
 Total Income | $120,000
 |
 Adjustment: Traditional 401k | 19,500
 Adjustment: HSA | 3550
 Adjustment: Traditional IRA | 0 (Remember, you're in a Roth)
 Adjustment: Student Loan Interest* | $500
 |
 Total Adjustments | $23,550
 |
 Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) (Total Income - Total Adjustments) | $96,950
{{</table>}}
<!--*There may be a chance you cannot deduct all of your student loan interest! You can read a simplified breakdown of the details here.-->

Step 3: Standard Deduction or Itemized Deduction?
----
The next step is to determine which deduction to take. If you can itemize a number of eligible deductions such that they all add up to more than the standard deduction, you should take the itemized deduction. 

Here are some of the most common things to look out for that might make it more beneficial for you to itemize, with articles into each of how they're calculated:

- A large amount of medical and dental expenses paid
- State and local real estate / property taxes (SALT)
- Home Mortgage interest
- Large amounts of gifts to charity

For the purposes of this exercise, we'll assume you recently bought a home and have been paying your mortgage, with a large property tax bill coming up. In addition, you don't expect any huge medical or dental procedures this year.

{{<table "table table-striped table-bordered" >}}
  Deductions | Value 
  ------------- | -------------
 Home Mortgage Interest Paid | $8,000
 SALT (via property tax) | $2,500
 |
 Total Itemized Deduction | $10,500
 Standard Deduction | $12,400
 {{</table>}}

Based on these calculations above, this means you should just take the **standard deduction** to reduce your taxes! 

Step 4: Subtract your deduction from your AGI to get your Regular Taxable Income
----
Remember, this is the 'taxable income' you would use to calculate your Regular Income Tax
{{<table "table table-striped table-bordered" >}}
  Line Item | Value 
  ------------- | -------------
 Total Income | $120,000
 Subtract Total Adjustments | $23,550
 |
 Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) | $96,950
 Subtract Standard Deduction | $12,400
 |
 Regular Taxable Income | $84,550
 {{</table>}}

Step 5: Figure out your Alternative Minimum Taxable Income (AMTI)
----

Using the Regular Taxable Income we've determined as the starting point, we need to add in a few things to determine our AMTI. These are commonly **specific ineligible deductions** and your **ISO Exercise Spread**. 

For the first piece, the most common AMT specific ineligible deductions include the below. [You can read more about the differences here](/posts/amt-regular-tax-differences).

- Personal Exemptions (which are currently removed from the tax system altogether)
- The Standard Deduction, if you took it. Else, if you took the itemized deduction:
- Medical Expense Deductions
- State and local real estate / property taxes (SALT)

In our case we, we only took the standard deduction ($12,400) so we only need to worry about that.

The second piece is around your ISO Exercise Spread. The short definition of the ISO Exercise Spread is the difference between your Strike Price and the Fair Market Value of your company's stock at time of exercise. You then take your spread and multiply it by the number of options exercised. You can think of this almost like the 'total discount' you 'received' when exercising your options. 

<!--There are many other caveats such as whether you sell any of your exercised options in the same calendar year. For more details, check out this article which explains everything in simple terms!-->

For this example, let's assume you exercised 1,500 options at a strike price of $1.00. At the time of exercising, your company has a Fair Market Value (FMV) of $5.00. Let's calculate the spread.

{{<table "table table-striped table-bordered" >}}
  Line Item | Value 
  ------------- | -------------
 Number of Options Exercised | 1,500
 Fair Market Value | $5.00
 Strike Price | $1.00
 Spread (per option) | $4.00
 |
 Total 'ISO Exercise Spread' | $6,000
 {{</table>}}

Now that we have our 2 additional components, let's calculate the AMTI

{{<table "table table-striped table-bordered" >}}
  Line Item | Value 
  ------------- | -------------
 Total Income | $120,000
 Subtract Total Adjustments | $23,550
 |
 Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) | $96,950
 Subtract Standard Deduction | $12,400
 |
 Regular Taxable Income | $84,550
 Add back in Ineligible Deductions (standard deduction, in our case)| $12,400
 Add in your ISO Exercise Spread | $6,000
 | 
 Alternative Minimum Taxable Income (AMTI) | $102,950
 {{</table>}}
 
Step 6: Subtract your AMT Exemption to get your Final AMTI
----
The AMT Exemption is a special exemption you can take as part of the AMT tax system. It is a very straightforward calculation up until you start making in excess of around $500,000 as a single filer, or over around $1 million dollars as married, filing jointly. If you fall into this category, I would advise you to spend a minute or two reading up on [the math behind the phaseout thresholds](/posts/amt-regular-tax-differences).

This is essentially a large chunk of money you can subtract from your AMTI before calculating the actual AMT you owe. Think of it like a special type of standard deduction, that almost everyone can take. The exemption is:

- $72,900 for single filers in 2020 and 
- $113,400 for Married, Filing Jointly in 2020
 
 {{<table "table table-striped table-bordered" >}}
  Line Item | Value 
  ------------- | -------------
 Total Income | $120,000
 Subtract Total Adjustments | $23,550
 |
 Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) | $96,950
 Subtract Standard Deduction | $12,400
 |
 Regular Taxable Income | $84,550
 Add back in Ineligible Deductions (standard deduction, in our case)| $12,400
 Add in your ISO Exercise Spread | $6,000
 | 
 Alternative Minimum Taxable Income (AMTI) | $102,950
 Subtract AMT Exemption | $72,900
 |
 'Final Alternative Minimum Taxable Income (FAMTI)' | $30,050
 {{</table>}}

Step 7: Calculate your Alternative Minimum Tax
----
We're at the home stretch! All that's left is to calculate your AMT and Regular Income tax, and figure out which is larger.

The AMT tax bracket functions just like the regular income tax brackets, in that it is marginal tax, but much simpler. There are only 2 tax rates. Everything under a certain amount is taxed at one percentage, and everything over is at the other. 

Note, this is one of the few instances where being Married could increase the overall taxes you owe. See below and notice how the 28% tax rate threshold is the same regardless of if you're single or not.

{{<table "table table-striped table-bordered" >}}
  Alternative Minimum Tax Rate | Single Filing, Taxable Income Over | Married, Filing Jointly, Taxable Income Over
  ------------- | ------------- |-------------
 26% | $0 | $0
 28% | $197,900 | $197,900
{{</table>}}

In our case, luckily, our FAMTI of $30,050 is much lower than the thershold of $197,900. This means everything will be taxed at a 26% tax rate, which brings us to our final number - the AMT we actually owe!

{{<table "table table-striped table-bordered" >}}
  Line Item | Value 
  ------------- | -------------
 Total Income | $120,000
 Subtract Total Adjustments | $23,550
 |
 Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) | $96,950
 Subtract Standard Deduction | $12,400
 |
 Regular Taxable Income | $84,550
 Add back in Ineligible Deductions (standard deduction, in our case)| $12,400
 Add in your ISO Exercise Spread | $6,000
 | 
 Alternative Minimum Taxable Income (AMTI) | $102,950
 Subtract AMT Exemption | $72,900
 |
 'Final Alternative Minimum Taxable Income (FAMTI)' | $30,050
 |
 Alternative Minimum Tax Owed (Taxed @ 26%) | $7,813
 {{</table>}}

 Step 8: Calculate your Regular Income Tax
----
But do you actually need to pay **$7,813?**

It all depends if this number is greater than or less than your regular income tax! There are many websites show you how to calculate the regular income tax you may owe, so I won't go into detail here. Using all the same parameters that we have used throughout this example:

Take my word for it, but your regular income tax would come out to: **$10,181**

 Step 9: So... what do I owe?
----
Because your AMT comes out to less than your Regular Income Tax, in this case, you wouldn't need to worry about your AMT at all! Just pay your regular income tax as you normally would, and you'll be good to go. Like I mentioned, most tax programs will account for all of this.

I should also mention that all of this is still within the realm of federal income taxes (FICA). None of this takes into account state taxes, which is a whole 'nother ball game. Luckily, only a few states have AMT at the state level, and we'll have an article up soon detailing this.

This exercise is most useful if you want to plan for how much of your ISO to exercise this year, such that this exact scenario arises. This way, you could avoid having to pay any additional taxes beyond your regular income tax. If you don't feel like doing it manually, [we've luckily built out a planning tool here](/iso-exercise-planner)
