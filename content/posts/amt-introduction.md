The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) is a separate tax that you have to calculate in parallel to your regular income tax. Each has a [slightly different set of rules](/posts/amt-regular-tax-differences) for what is deductible and different limits to the marginal tax brackets. Every year you, or your tax filing program, will determine both your regular income tax and alternative minimum tax. **You only end up paying the higher of the two.** For the vast majority of people and for most of your tax filing years, you will not need to worry about calculating the AMT. This is likely why you may not have heard about the AMT until now. 

Below are some of the most common cases for when the AMT might trigger:

Exercising Incentive Stock Options (ISOs)
-----
This is by far the most common reason why AMT is triggered. If you exercise ISOs received from your employer and do not sell them in the same calendar year, the spread of your exercise (difference between fair market value and strike price at time of exercise) factors into the AMT calculation and may make you eligible for AMT. [You can read more about it here.](/posts/amt-taxes)

This is why, especially in the case of exercising ISOs, planning when to exercise and how much you can exercise is an often overlooked and significant money saving technique. Luckily, you can plan for this using this simple AMT Exercise Planner.

Realizing a large long term capital gain
-----
Although you won't be taxed any differently on your long term capital gain, realizing too much may make you ineligible for certain AMT specific deductions, which could ultimately cause you to have to pay AMT. 

More to come on this point

Making too much money 
-----
Seriously - similar to the above if your ordinary income exceeds the phase-out thresholds for the AMT specific deductions, it may make you liable to pay the alternative minimum tax. Rest assured, this won't affect the majority of folks, as the AMT deduction phase out threshold **starts** at $518,400 for single filers and $1,036,800 for married.
